# Function to generate vector of hours worked by age from CPS data
This repository contains the work for creating a Python function `hrs_by_age()` that takes as inputs a vector of age cutoffs, a "MMYY" numerical string beginning CPS survey month to use and a "MMYY" numerical string ending CPS survey month to use. This function returns a vector of average hours by age group that is the same size as the vector of age cutoffs.

The CPS data files are available on the NBER CPS data page at [http://nber.org/data/cps_basic.html](http://nber.org/data/cps_basic.html). The URL for each file and the format for a given month of the data file (compressed .zip) is `http://nber.org/cps-basic/monYYpub.zip`, where "mon" is the lower-case first three letters of a given month and "YY" are the last two digits of the four-digit year. For example, the data for the January 2017 survey compressed data file is [http://nber.org/cps-basic/jan17pub.zip](http://nber.org/cps-basic/jan17pub.zip).

When the compressed file is unzipped, the resulting data file has the form "monYYpub.dat". These .dat files are fixed with text files. The dictionary for the beginning column number of each variable for data from January 2015 on is available at [http://nber.org/data/progs/cps-basic/cpsbjan2015.dct](http://nber.org/data/progs/cps-basic/cpsbjan2015.dct). Value labels for some of the varialbes for data from January 2015 on are available at [http://nber.org/data/progs/cps-basic/cpsbjan2015.do](http://nber.org/data/progs/cps-basic/cpsbjan2015.do).
